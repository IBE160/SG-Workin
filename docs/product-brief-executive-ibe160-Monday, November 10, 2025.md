## 1. Problem Statement

Prospective and current university students struggle to find clear and accessible information about study programs due to the university website's poor organization. This difficulty leads to significant frustration and can result in prospective students abandoning their applications in favor of other universities, while current students may experience a decline in motivation.

Consequently, university staff spend 3-4 hours per week answering repetitive questions that should be easily self-serviced, diverting their time from more complex student support tasks. The existing website, as the primary information source, fails to meet user needs, creating a negative experience and potential loss of student enrollment.

This project aims to address these issues within a 3-week timeframe to deliver a functional solution as part of a school project.

## 2. Proposed Solution

We propose the development of an AI-powered chatbot, accessible with a single click from the university website, to serve as the primary, user-friendly interface for all study program-related inquiries.

**Core Approach:**
The chatbot's essential function is to provide immediate, accurate answers to student questions, supplemented with links to the original source material on the university website and optional "more information" links for deeper exploration.

**Key Differentiators:**
This solution surpasses a simple website search or FAQ page through two key differentiators:
1.  **Interactive Guidance:** The chatbot actively guides users by asking questions to refine their queries, ensuring they find the correct information even if they don't know what to search for.
2.  **Information Synthesis:** It can instantly gather and synthesize information from multiple, disparate pages on the university website, presenting a single, consolidated answer that would otherwise require significant manual effort from the user.

## 3. Target Users

#### Primary User Segment 1: Prospective Students

*   **Profile:** Typical high school graduates who are generally tech-savvy and in the process of exploring higher education options.
*   **Goals:** To discover and evaluate potential study programs, including understanding options for extra courses, specializations, and program expansions.
*   **Pain Points:** They experience significant frustration due to the website's poor organization and complex navigation, which can lead them to abandon their research and consider other universities.

#### Primary User Segment 2: Current Students

*   **Profile:** Enrolled students from all years of study who are actively managing their academic journey.
*   **Goals:** To find accurate information about available courses and their prerequisites to plan their semesters and ensure they meet degree requirements.
*   **Pain Points:** They are hindered by poor search functionality and complex navigation on the website, and find that academic advisors are often overwhelmed with basic questions.

## 5. Financial Impact & Strategic Alignment

#### Financial Impact

The project will be developed exclusively using free-tier services for all technologies. This ensures that the development and initial deployment of the chatbot will incur no direct financial cost. The primary investment will be the development time and effort within the 3-week project timeline.

#### Strategic Alignment

While this is a school project, the chatbot aligns with broader university objectives by:
*   **Improving Student Experience:** Enhancing access to critical information for both prospective and current students.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Potentially reducing the administrative burden on staff by automating responses to common inquiries.
*   **Innovation:** Demonstrating the university's commitment to leveraging modern AI technologies to support its community.
