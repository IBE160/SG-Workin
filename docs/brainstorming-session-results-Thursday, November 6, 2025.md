### Session Goal

To generate creative and practical ideas for a university AI chatbot project focused on providing information about study programs.

### Key Project Principles

*   **Simplicity:** The application should be easy to make and easy to use.
*   **Focus:** The primary goal is to provide quick and easy access to information about study programs.
*   **General Advice:** The chatbot will provide general information rather than personalizing responses based on user roles.
*   **Single Source of Truth:** The chatbot will exclusively use the university's official website as its information source.

### Top 3 Priorities & Next Steps

1.  **Basic Q&A for Study Programs**
    *   **Why:** This is the main reason for the chatbot – to provide quick answers.
    *   **Next Step:** Get relevant data by scraping the university website.

2.  **Suggesting Study Paths**
    *   **Why:** To provide counseling and guidance on long-term study options.
    *   **Next Step:** Scrape the necessary data from the website.

3.  **Suggesting Program Combinations**
    *   **Why:** To provide counseling and guidance on combining different fields of study.
    *   **Next Step:** Scrape the necessary data from the website.

### Other Key Features ("Quick Wins")

*   **Daily Website Scraping:** To keep information up-to-date (with adjustable frequency for an admin).
*   **"Contact Us" Link:** For questions the chatbot cannot answer.
*   **User Satisfaction Survey:** A 1-10 scale and optional comment at the end of each chat.
*   **Email Conversation Log:** Allow users to receive a transcript of their chat.
*   **Forward Log on Escalation:** Send the chat history to staff when a question is escalated.
*   **Multilingual Support.**
*   **Graceful Handling of Complex Questions:** Asks users to rephrase their questions.

This concludes our brainstorming session. You now have a clear set of priorities and a solid foundation for your project brief.
