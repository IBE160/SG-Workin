## Case Title
FAQ Chatbot for a University Website

## Background
University websites often contain a large amount of information that can be difficult for visitors to navigate. Students, applicants, and staff frequently have recurring questions about admissions, programs, deadlines, and services. A chatbot can automate responses, providing instant and consistent answers, while reducing the workload on administrative staff.

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to create an AI-powered FAQ chatbot that helps users quickly find accurate information from the university’s website. It will answer questions related to studies, admission, facilities, and contact information, improving accessibility and user experience.

## Target Users
- Prospective students seeking program and admission information  
- Current students looking for academic or administrative details  
- Visitors and staff needing general university information

## User Stories (Optional)
1. As a **prospective student**, I want to ask questions about study programs so that I can find the right degree for me.  
2. As a **current student**, I want to get information about deadlines and exams so that I can plan my studies efficiently.  
3. As a **visitor**, I want to ask for directions or contact details so that I can reach the correct department easily.
